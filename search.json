    "text": "Wikipedia aims to represent all of the information and views on a topic or person that have been published in reliable sources. It is up to you to distinguish reliable sources from unreliable sources, and to distinguish opinion from fact.\nIf a person or topic is controversial, represent the facts of the controversy: what are the sides and what is the evidence on each side. In your writing, attribute opinions to the person whose opinions they are and state facts without attribution. For example, it is a fact that Nettie Stevens was a geneticist, but it is Richardson’s opinion that one of the most impressive things Stevens did was to participate in debates about sex determination. So you would say something like this:\n\n\nNettie Stevens was a geneticist who made important contributions to the chromosomal theory of sex in the first decade of the twentieth century. The historian of science Sarah Richardson has argued that her “role as a bold contestant in theoretical debates over the mechanism of sex determination…despite her meager platform as a research associate at a suburban women’s college” is “the most overlooked and impressive dimension of Stevens’s contribution to the chromosomal theory of sex.”\n\n\nFacts should, nonetheless, be footnoted to establish their verifiability. Do not give your own opinion unless it has already been published in a reliable source. When presenting opposing views on a topic or person, make clear how much support or evidence each side has. For example there is much more evidence that vaccines prevent disease than that they cause injury, so you would not present these sides of the vaccine debate as if they were equal. The weight given to a view should represent the quantity of evidence for it and number of people who hold it. As much as possible, present controversies in an impartial tone rather than quoting people on either side."

    "section": "Verifiability",
    "text": "Verifiability\nAll information should come from reliable sources, and all statements should be verifiable, even if you do not include a citation for each one. Citations are required for quotations, statements that have been or are likely to be challenged, and anything potentially contentious about a living or recently deceased person. If you find unsubstantiated statements in existing articles, you can add a {{citation needed}} tag, or add a citation yourself. Exceptional claims need multiple high-quality sources.\nWikipedia classifies peer-reviewed academic publications as the most reliable, but respected mainstream publications are also considered reliable, especially newspapers with editorial oversight and a professional structure for fact-checking. Self-published sources (where the author publishes the source themself) are not reliable, but may be used to a limited degree for biographies of living individuals. Wikipedia may not be used as a source, unless Wikipedia itself is being discussed in the article, though you should link to other Wikipedia pages when possible.\nA source does not need to be publicly accessible in order to be referenced. Non-English references may be used, but English-language sources are preferred.\nDo not plagiarize! Information from sources must be rewritten in your own words or directly quoted."

Be very careful with material that might harm a person’s reputation.\nSelf-published sources are fine if they are written by the person themself, is not unduly self-serving, and does not involve claims about other people. You can use the person’s social media account to verify things like date of birth. Do not discuss the person’s religion or sexual orientation unless the person has publicly self-identified with the religion or orientation, or if these are relevant to their notability.\nA living person accused of a crime should be presumed innocent until convicted in a court of law."
